abstract: Candida albicans is a commensal fungus of the human gastrointestinal
  tract and a prevalent opportunistic pathogen. To examine diversity within this
  species, extensive genomic and phenotypic analyses were performed on 21
  clinical C. albicans isolates. Genomic variation was evident in the form of
  polymorphisms, copy number variations, chromosomal inversions, subtelomeric
  hypervariation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and whole or partial chromosome
  aneuploidies. All 21 strains were diploid, although karyotypic changes were
  present in eight of the 21 isolates, with multiple strains being trisomic for
  Chromosome 4 or Chromosome 7. Aneuploid strains exhibited a general fitness
  defect relative to euploid strains when grown under replete conditions. All
  strains were also heterozygous, yet multiple, distinct LOH tracts were present
  in each isolate. Higher overall levels of genome heterozygosity correlated
  with faster growth rates, consistent with increased overall fitness. Genes
  with the highest rates of amino acid substitutions included many cell wall
  proteins, implicating fast evolving changes in cell adhesion and host
  interactions. One clinical isolate, P94015, presented several striking
  properties including a novel cellular phenotype, an inability to filament,
  drug resistance, and decreased virulence. Several of these properties were
  shown to be due to a homozygous nonsense mutation in the EFG1 gene.
  Furthermore, loss of EFG1 function resulted in increased fitness of P94015 in
  a commensal model of infection. Our analysis therefore reveals intra-species
  genetic and phenotypic differences in C. albicans and delineates a natural
  mutation that alters the balance between commensalism and pathogenicity.
