  The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans lacks a conventional sexual
  program and is thought to evolve, at least primarily, through the clonal

  acquisition of genetic changes. Here, we performed an analysis of heterozygous diploid genomes from 21 clinical isolates to determine the natural evolutionary processes acting on the C. albicans genome. Mutation and recombination shaped the

  genomic landscape among the C. albicans isolates. Strain-specific single nucleotide

  polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels) clustered across the genome.

  Additionally, loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events contributed substantially to genotypic variation, with most long-tract LOH events extending to the ends of the chromosomes suggestive of repair via break-induced replication. Consistent with a model

  of inheritance by descent, most polymorphisms were shared between closely related

  strains. However, some isolates contained highly mosaic genomes consistent with

  strains having experienced interclade recombination during their evolutionary history. A detailed examination of mitochondrial genomes also revealed clear examples

  of interclade recombination among sequenced strains. These analyses therefore establish that both (para)sexual recombination and mitotic mutational processes drive

  evolution of this important pathogen. To further facilitate the study of C. albicans

  genomes, we also introduce an online platform, SNPMap, to examine SNP patterns

  in sequenced isolates.
