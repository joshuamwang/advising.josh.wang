    #   text: Getting accepted into medical school shouldn't be so difficult. You know to study hard for your exams and MCAT, to get shadowing hours, and to gain broader experience through clinical volunteering and research. What's often less clear is how to then package all of your experiences together into a cohesive and compelling story. The "X" factor, as many call it, doesn't require you to cure cancer, solve world hunger, or eliminate global poverty. It could be offering companionship to geriatric patients with your music talents, starting the first cultural heritage club on your school's campus, or mobilizing makeshift covid testing during the pandemic. For me, it involved sharing my vision on how I could apply my computer science background to revolutionize clinical care. 


    #     The unfortunate reality is that admission readers have no more than 10 minutes to review your application. It's your job as the applicant to organize your life story into a coherent narrative that readers can understand within a first glance. Let's work together to find your strength and learn how to sell it as a cohesive story (both in narrative and interview form) for admission committees.
