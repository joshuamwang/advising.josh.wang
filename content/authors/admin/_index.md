I am a 5th year MD/PhD student at NYU School of Medicine. My research interests include building machine learning models that integrate multiple clinical data modalities to predict medical outcomes. Projects included forecasting COVID-19 outcomes from clinical data, predicting molecular mutations from digital histopathology, and identifying multi-omic biomarkers predictive of treatment response. <br /> <br />
Oh, I‚Äôm also a finances, investing and stock market enthusiast üìà.
